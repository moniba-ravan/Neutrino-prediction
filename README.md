## Project: Neutrino Energy and Direction Prediction using Transformer Models

### Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline using **Transformer neural networks** to predict the **energy** and **arrival direction** of neutrinos. Neutrinos are subatomic particles that are challenging to detect, and accurately predicting their properties from raw data is crucial in fields such as particle physics and astrophysics.

### Contribution Statement
In this project, the goal was to implement Transformer-based models to predict neutrino event energy and direction. The team worked collaboratively, holding regular meetings, sharing insights, and supporting each other to ensure the success of the project. Below is a summary of individual contributions:

1. **Chen Gu**
   - Focused on implementing one version of the Transformer model.
   - Led the implementation and development of the final original Transformer model.
   - Trained and fine-tuned the Transformer model with various hyperparameters.
   - Collaborated with the team to debug and understand all aspects of the project.

2. **Sam Siamak Farkhooi**
   - Focused on implementing one version of the Transformer model.
   - Led the implementation and development of the final Vision Transformer model.
   - Trained and optimized the Vision Transformer model by tuning hyperparameters.
   - Collaborated with the team to debug and understand all aspects of the project.

3. **SeyedehMoniba Ravan**
   - Focused on implementing one version of the Transformer model.
   - Merged and restructured the initial CNN-based project to enable seamless integration of the three models (CNN, Vision Transformer, and Transformer).
   - Enhanced the data loader by incorporating additional dataset information.
   - Evaluated and visualized the final trained models on the test dataset.
   - Collaborated with the team to debug and understand all aspects of the project.

The final versions of the models reflect individual contributions (Sam’s Vision Transformer, Chen’s Transformer, and Moniba’s integration and evaluation work). However, the team worked collectively at every stage, exchanging ideas, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring the smooth integration of all components to achieve the project’s objectives.
