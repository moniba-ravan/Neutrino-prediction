## Project: Neutrino Energy and Direction Prediction using Transformer Models

### Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline using **Transformer neural networks** to predict the **energy** and **arrival direction** of neutrinos. Neutrinos are subatomic particles that are challenging to detect, and accurately predicting their properties from raw data is crucial in fields such as particle physics and astrophysics.

We also thank the research group for providing datasets and support throughout the development of this project.

### Contribution Statement
In this project, the goal was to implement Transformer-based models to predict neutrino event energy and direction. The team worked collaboratively, holding regular meetings, sharing insights, and supporting each other to ensure the success of the project.
The final versions of the models reflect individual contributions (Sam’s Vision Transformer, Chen’s Transformer, and Moniba’s integration and evaluation work). However, the team worked collectively at every stage, exchanging ideas, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring the smooth integration of all components to achieve the project’s objectives.
