## Project: Neutrino Energy and Direction Prediction using Transformer Models

### Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline using **Transformer neural networks** to predict the **energy** and **arrival direction** of neutrinos. Neutrinos are subatomic particles that are challenging to detect, and accurately predicting their properties from raw data is crucial in fields such as particle physics and astrophysics.
