## Project: Neutrino Energy and Direction Prediction using Transformer Models

### Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline using **Transformer neural networks** to predict the **energy** and **arrival direction** of neutrinos. Neutrinos are subatomic particles that are challenging to detect, and accurately predicting their properties from raw data is crucial in fields such as particle physics and astrophysics.

Our model leverages **Transformers**, originally designed for natural language processing, to handle time-series or structured input data representing the raw signals from antennas. By learning the complex relationships between the input features, we aim to improve prediction accuracy for neutrino properties.

### Future Work
- **Generative Models (GANs)**: If time permits, we plan to experiment with **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** or other models to enhance data generation or to compare and potentially improve the transformer modelâ€™s performance in predicting neutrino properties.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: We will continue optimizing the transformer architecture, possibly exploring hybrid models or advanced attention mechanisms to further improve accuracy.
- **Performance Metrics**: Once fully trained, we will evaluate the model on key metrics such as mean squared error for energy prediction and angular deviation for direction prediction.
